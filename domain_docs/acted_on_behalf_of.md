> Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an agent (by
> itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity as a delegate or
> representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of retains some
> responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work. For example, a student
> acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the department
> chair, who acted on behalf of the university; all those agents are responsible
> in some way for the activity that took place but we do not say explicitly who
> bears responsibility and to what degree.
