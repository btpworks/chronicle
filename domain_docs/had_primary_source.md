# `prov:hadPrimarySource`

> A primary source for a topic refers to something produced by
> some agent with direct experience and knowledge about the topic,
> at the time of the topic's study, without benefit from hindsight.
> Because of the directness of primary sources, they 'speak for
> themselves' in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of
> secondary sources. As such, it is important for secondary sources
> to reference those primary sources from which they were derived,
> so that their reliability can be investigated. A primary source
> relation is a particular case of derivation of secondary materials
> from their primary sources. It is recognized that the determination
> of primary sources can be up to interpretation, and should be done
> according to conventions accepted within the application's domain.
