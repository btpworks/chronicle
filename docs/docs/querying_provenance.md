#Â Querying Provenance

Currently Chronicle has 4 root queries.

``` graphql
type Query {
    activityTimeline(activityTypes: [ActivityType!]!, forEntity: [EntityID!]!, from: DateTime, to: DateTime, namespace: ID, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): ActivityConnection!
    agentsByType(agentType: AgentType!, namespace: String, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): AgentConnection!
    agentById(id: AgentID!, namespace: String): Agent
    entityById(id: EntityID!, namespace: String): Entity
}
```

The majority of the work for provenance retrieval will be with the [activity timeline](#activity-timeline) query.

Familiarizing yourself with GraphQL is necessary to make good use of Chronicle. Chronicle makes extensive use of [relay cursors](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) and [union types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/).


## Activity timeline

#### activityTypes

A list of ActivityTypes to filter the returned timeline by, leaving this empty will return all activity types. The `PROV_ACTIVITY` activity type can be used to return activities that are not currently specified in the Chronicle domain.

``` graphql
enum ActivityType {
	PROV_ACTIVITY
	PUBLISHED
	QUESTION_ASKED
	RESEARCHED
	REVISED
}

```

## agentsByType

## agentById

## entityById


## Returned objects
