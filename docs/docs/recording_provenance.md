#Â Recording Provenance using Chronicle

## Immutability

Chronicle provenance is immutable. Once recorded you cannot contradict it - only record additional provenance.

## Open world model

Chronicle does not use relational constraints in the way you may expect a relational database to, or allow free form data in the manner of a document store. It is useful to think of Chronicle as recording facts, and it will make simple inferences to keep your provenance data consistent.

For example:

``` graphql title="The agent 'homer' participated in the activity 'writing-the-iliad' as a writer"
mutation {
    wasAssociatedWith(
        activity: "chronicle:activity:writing-the-iliad",
        agent: "chronicle:agent:homer",
        role: writer
    )
}
```

``` graphql title="There was an activity 'writing-the-iliad' that took place in Ionia"
mutation {
    writing(
        name: "writing-the-iliad",
        attributes: {
            location: "ionia"
        }
    )
}
```


``` graphql title="An agent 'homer' exists and was a person"
mutation {
    person(
        name: "homer",
        attributes: {
            email: "homer@ionia.gr"
        }
    )
}
```

These three Chronicle mutations can be executed in *any* order - Chronicle will assume the existence of the Agent and Activities referred to even if they have not yet been recorded by their `person` and `writing` mutation.

## Contradiction

Chronicle will not allow you to record provenance that contradicts previously recorded provenance. For example - you cannot change the start / end dates of activities once set, or alter the value of an attributes. You can however record identical provenance any number of times, as this does not cause contradiction, or change the state of Chronicle meaningfully.

### Contradiction of attribute time

Here we attempt to change the end date of an activity after it has been recorded - one of these mutations will fail

``` graphql
    mutation {
        endActivity(id:"chronicle:activity:birthday",
            time: "2022-07-29T12:41:52.433Z"
        )

        endActivity(id:"chronicle:activity:birthday",
            time: "2020-07-29T12:41:52.433Z"
        )
    }
```

### Contradiction of attribute value

Here we attempt to change the value of an attribute - one of these operations will fail.

``` graphql
    mutation {
        writer(id: "chronicle:agent:poet", attributes: {
            name: "Tennyson"
        })
    }

    mutation {
        writer(id: "chronicle:agent:poet", attributes: {
            name: "Kipling"
        })
    }
```

### Extending attributes is not a contradiction

Where a provenance term has been recorded with attributes, and the domain has been extended to include new attributes it is valid to append new attributes, as long as the values of the already recorded ones are unchanged.

``` graphql

    mutation {
        writer(id: "chronicle:agent:poet", attributes: {
            name: "Tennyson"
        })
    }

    mutation {
        writer(id: "chronicle:agent:poet", attributes: {
            name: "Tennyson",
            heightInCentimeters: "185"
        })
    }
```

## Operations

### Example domain

For this section we will use a our simplified [domain model for recording the provenance of medical guidance](./domain_modelling.md). We have a number of people who may be any combination of authors, editors or researchers collaborating to produce documents from evidence produced by a search process. An external CMS is being used that has identifiers for documents and users.

### The `name` parameter

The definition mutations for prov terms -  Entity, Activity and Agent are all supplied with a `name` parameter. This should be something meaningful to the domain you are recording provenance for - a unique identifier from an external system or a natural key. This will form part of the identity of the term.

### A note on identities

Chronicle identities will contain an encoded form of the name parameter, but should be treated as opaque. Under no circumstances should you attempt to synthesize an identity from Chronicle in client code as the scheme may be subject to change.

### Graphql mutation result - `Submission`

All Chronicle mutations return a `Submission` type defined by:

``` graphql
type Submission {
	context: String!
	correlationId: String!
}
```

The `context` property here will be the identity of the Chronicle term you have changed in the mutation. i.e calling `agent(..)` will return the identity of the agent, calling `startActivity(..)` the identity of the started activity.

The `correlationId` property corresponds to the transaction id when running chronicle with a backend ledger, or a randomly generated uuid when used in [in memory](./chronicle_architecture.md/#development) mode.

### Commit notification subscriptions

Chronicle provides a [graphql subscription](https://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) to notify clients when a chronicle operation has completed.

``` graphql

type Submission {
	context: String!
	correlationId: String!
}

subscription {
    commitNotifications {
        correlationId
    }
}

```

The `correlationId` on this subscription will match the correlationId from the [Submission](#graphql-mutation-result---submission). Clients that wish to know the result of an operation should await both the [Submission](#graphql-mutation-result---submission) and the corresponding correlation id from a commit notification.


### Define an Entity

> In PROV, things we want to describe the provenance of are called entities and have some fixed aspects. The term "things" encompasses a broad diversity of notions, including digital objects such as a file or web page, physical things such as a mountain, a building, a printed book, or a car as well as abstract concepts and ideas.
> An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#entity)

Using our example domain, Chronicle will have generated four entity subtypes for us, `Question`, `Guidance`, `PublishedGuidance` and `Evidence` as a graphql union called `Entity`. The union also contains an untyped entity `ProvEntity`. The untyped entity can be potentially returned where the domain definition has evolved, see [evolving your domain](domain_modelling.md#evolution).

The definition mutations `question`, `guidance`, `publishedGuidance` and `evidence` will also have been created to allow you to define an instance of each subtype and their attributes. The generated graphql mutations and their associated types will look like this:

``` graphql

scalar EntityID
scalar DomaintypeID
type Evidence {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
	searchParametersAttribute: SearchParameterAttribute
	referenceAttribute: ReferenceAttribute
}
input EvidenceAttributes {
	searchParametersAttribute: String!
	referenceAttribute: String!
}
type Guidance {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
	titleAttribute: TitleAttribute
	versionAttribute: VersionAttribute
}
input GuidanceAttributes {
	titleAttribute: String!
	versionAttribute: Int!
}

input PublishedAttributes {
	versionAttribute: Int!
}
type PublishedGuidance {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
}

type Question {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
	cmsIdAttribute: CmsIdAttribute
	contentAttribute: ContentAttribute
}

input QuestionAttributes {
	cmsIdAttribute: String!
	contentAttribute: String!
}

type ProvEntity {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
}

input ProvEntityAttributes {
	type: String
}

union Entity = | ProvEntity | Evidence | Guidance | PublishedGuidance | Question

mutation {
	entity(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: ProvEntityAttributes!): Submission!
	evidence(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: EvidenceAttributes!): Submission!
	guidance(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: GuidanceAttributes!): Submission!
	publishedGuidance(name: String!, namespace: String): Submission!
	question(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: QuestionAttributes!): Submission!
}

```

Executing the following example mutation `question` will define an `Entity` of subtype `Question`, along with its attributes.
``` graphql title="Define a Question entity with graphql"
mutation {
    question(name: "anaphylaxis-referral", attributes: {
        cmsIdAttribute: "0c6fa8c5-69da-43d1-95d6-726f5f671b30",
        contentAttribute: "How best to assess and refer patients who have required emergency treatment for Anaphylaxis",
    })
}
```

And the equivalent operation using the command line interface is

``` bash title="Define a document entity with the CLI"
chronicle question define anaphylaxis-referral --cms-id-attribute "How best to assess and refer patients who have required emergency treatment for Anaphylaxis" --cms-id-attr "0c6fa8c5-69da-43d1-95d6-726f5f671b30"

```

Either operation will return the ID of the newly defined question

### Define an Activity

> An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities. Just as entities cover a broad range of notions, activities can cover a broad range of notions: information processing activities may for example move, copy, or duplicate digital entities; physical activities can include driving a car between two locations or printing a book.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#activity)

Chronicle will have generated four `Activity` subtypes for us, `QuestionAsked`, `Researched`, `Revised` and `Published` as a graphql union called `Activity`. The union also contains an untyped activity `ProvActivity`. The untyped activity can be potentially returned where the domain definition has evolved, see [evolving your domain](domain_modelling.md#evolution).

 The definition mutations `questionAsked` `researched`, `revised` and `published` will also have been created to allow you to define an instance of each subtype and their attributes. The generated graphql mutations and their associated types will look like this:

``` graphql
union Activity = | ProvActivity | Published | QuestionAsked | Researched | Revised

type ProvEntity {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
}
input ProvEntityAttributes {
	type: String
}
type Published {
	id: ActivityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	started: DateTime
	ended: DateTime
	type: DomaintypeID
	wasAssociatedWith: [Association!]!
	used: [Entity!]!
	versionAttribute: VersionAttribute
}
input PublishedAttributes {
	versionAttribute: Int!
}
type PublishedGuidance {
	id: EntityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	type: DomaintypeID
	evidence: ChronicleEvidence
	wasGeneratedBy: [Activity!]!
	wasDerivedFrom: [Entity!]!
	hadPrimarySource: [Entity!]!
	wasRevisionOf: [Entity!]!
	wasQuotedFrom: [Entity!]!
}

type Researched {
	id: ActivityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	started: DateTime
	ended: DateTime
	type: DomaintypeID
	wasAssociatedWith: [Association!]!
	used: [Entity!]!
	searchParametersAttribute: SearchParameterAttribute
}
input ResearchedAttributes {
	searchParametersAttribute: String!
}
type Revised {
	id: ActivityID!
	namespace: Namespace!
	name: String!
	started: DateTime
	ended: DateTime
	type: DomaintypeID
	wasAssociatedWith: [Association!]!
	used: [Entity!]!
	cmsIdAttribute: CmsIdAttribute
	versionAttribute: VersionAttribute
}
input RevisedAttributes {
	cmsIdAttribute: String!
	versionAttribute: Int!
}

mutation {
	activity(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: ProvActivityAttributes!): Submission!
	published(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: PublishedAttributes!): Submission!
	questionAsked(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: QuestionAskedAttributes!): Submission!
	researched(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: ResearchedAttributes!): Submission!
	revised(name: String!, namespace: String, attributes: RevisedAttributes!): Submission!
}
```

The following example mutation `authoring` will define an `Activity` of subtype `Authoring`

``` graphql title="Define a revised activity with graphql"
mutation {
    revised(name: "september-2018-review", attributes: {
        versionAttribute: 14,
    })
}
```

And the equivalent operation using the command line interface is:

``` bash title="Define a document entity with the CLI"
chronicle revised define september-2018-review --version-attr 14
```

### Define an Agent

> An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#agent)

Chronicle will have generated two `Agent` subtypes for us, `Person` and `Organization` as a graphql union called `Agent`. The union also contains an untyped activity `ProvAgent`. The untyped agent can be potentially returned where the domain definition has evolved, see [evolving your domain](domain_modelling.md#evolution).

The definition mutations `person` and `organization` will also have been created. See [domain modelling](./domain_modelling.md/#graphql_generation) for details on the generated graphql SDL.


``` graphql title="Define an organization agent with graphql"
mutation {
    organization(name: "health-trust", attributes: {})
}
```

And the equivalent operation using the command line interface is:

``` bash title="Define an organization entity with the CLI"
chronicle organization define health-trust
```


### Used

> Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity. Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and could not have been affected by the entity.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#used)

Usage operations in Chronicle can applied to all subtypes of Entity and Activity.

To apply using graphql:

``` graphql
mutation {
	used(activity: "chronicle:activity:september-2018-review", entity: "chronicle:entity:anaphylaxis-guidance-9-2018")
}
```

And the equivalent operation using the command line interface is:

``` bash
chronicle revised use "chronicle:entity:anaphylaxis-guidance-9-2018" "chronicle:activity:september-2018-review"
```


### Generation

> Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity. This entity did not exist before generation and becomes available for usage after this generation.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#generation)


### Started at time

> Start is when an activity is deemed to have been started by an entity, known as trigger. The activity did not exist before its start. Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity follows the activity's start. A start may refer to a trigger entity that set off the activity, or to an activity, known as starter, that generated the trigger.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#started-at-time)

### Ended at time

> End is when an activity is deemed to have been ended by an entity, known as trigger. The activity no longer exists after its end. Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity precedes the activity's end. An end may refer to a trigger entity that terminated the activity, or to an activity, known as ender that generated the trigger.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#ended-at-time)

### Association

> An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#association)

### Delegation

> Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an agent (by itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity as a delegate or representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of retains some responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work. For example, a student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the department chair, who acted on behalf of the university; all those agents are responsible in some way for the activity that took place but we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what degree.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#delegation)

### Usage

> Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity. Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and could not have been affected by the entity.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#usage)

### Derivation

#### Primary Source

> A primary source for a topic refers to something produced by some agent with direct experience and knowledge about the topic, at the time of the topic's study, without benefit from hindsight. Because of the directness of primary sources, they 'speak for themselves' in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources. As such, it is important for secondary sources to reference those primary sources from which they were derived, so that their reliability can be investigated. A primary source relation is a particular case of derivation of secondary materials from their primary sources. It is recognized that the determination of primary sources can be up to interpretation, and should be done according to conventions accepted within the application's domain.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#primary-source)

#### Revision

> A revision is a derivation for which the resulting entity is a revised version of some original. The implication here is that the resulting entity contains substantial content from the original. Revision is a particular case of derivation.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#revision)

#### Quotation

> A quotation is the repeat of (some or all of) an entity, such as text or image, by someone who may or may not be its original author. Quotation is a particular case of derivation.

See [provenance concepts](./provenance_concepts.md#quotation)

### Had evidence

Evidence is a Chronicle specific provenance feature that simplifies the association of a cryptographic signature with an Entity.
