Lightweight todo, to save jira clicks


* Enough query for graphql to be useful
* Graphql mutations (Apicommand)
* Graphql subscriptions
* Daemonisation, with initial boot from CLI
* Fix the terrible IRI / identity handling with contexts and buf/ref types
* CLI connects to graphql
* CLI output works as Kevin suggested (uri outputs) to be composable, as we now have a query interface
* CLI handles domain types
* Secure graphql endpoint + UI
* Actuallly connect it to a real blockchain
* Emit committed events to subscriptions
* CLI optionally blocks on submitted or comitted
* Stress testing / benchmarks
* Cache control considerations, etags / timestamps from dbsync of comitted?

That's a 1.0
